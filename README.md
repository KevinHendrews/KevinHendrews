# سلام (Salam), I'm Mehad!

:technologist: 

I am a programmer mostly working with Python, Javascript, and SQL. More specifically, I often work with both Node.js and MySQL, and I also frequently work with the [RAGE:MP](https://rage.mp/) platform.

:floppy_disk:

The majority of my code is hidden in **private** repositories at the moment. If you're interested in my work, feel free to contact me for more information.

:construction_worker:

If anything I've posted on my Github is not working, feel free to reach out to me! I'd be glad to try and troubleshoot any issues or patch any bugs out. 

:mailbox_with_mail:

The best way to contact me is on Discord, mehad hamad#4819 (don't forget the space!)
