Known as KevY007, KevYBeasT, Rehaab, 0x32789 and formerly Kevin Hendrews/Scaletta. (roleplaying names, nothing more)

:construction_worker:
*I work with multiple languages, including C#, C++, JavaScript, Pawn/Amx, .NET, basic/beginner level SQL, Python, Lua and Java.*

I have a really inconsistent work of flow, I work with multiple languages at the same time or I don't target a specific language. I go with whatever suits my project regardless of how much knowledge I have and intend to self-learn and use it as experience.

#

:technologist: **Platforms I've openly worked on:** *(Mostly games)*
